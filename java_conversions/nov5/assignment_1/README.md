# Basic lambdas (Sort string array)

### Original Prompt:
- [ ] length (i.e., shortest to longest)
- [ ] reverse length (i.e., longest to shortest)
- [ ] alphabetically by the first character only
- [ ] Strings that contain “e” first, everything else second. For now, put the code directly in the lambda.
- [ ] Redo the previous problem, but use a static helper method so that your lambda looks like this:
      Arrays.sort(words, (s1,s2) -> Utils.yourMethod(s1,s2))
- [ ] Using Java 8 features write a method that returns a comma separated string based on a given list of  
      integers. Each element should be preceded by the letter 'e' if the number is even, and preceded by  
      the letter 'o' if the number is odd.
- [ ] Given a list of Strings, write a method that returns a list of all strings that start with the letter  
      'a' (lower case) and have exactly 3 letters.
