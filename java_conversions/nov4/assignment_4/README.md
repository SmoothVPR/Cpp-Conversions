# Unit Testing (Line Test)

### Original Prompt:
- [ ] For this exercise you will add JUnit tests for the Line Class
- [ ] Create a file called LineTest.java
- [ ] Create tests for the getSlope, getDistance and parallelTo methods
- [ ] Because of rounding errors, it is bad practice to test double 
      values for exact equality. To get around this, you can pass a 
      small value (such as .0001) to assertEquals to be used as a 
      delta
